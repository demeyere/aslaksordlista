Turn a Swedish audio into a podcast
===================================

+ duplicate the audio file
+ rename to amount of strech you wish to apply (eg, *-115.aiff)
+ open Adobe Audition
+ time and pitch
+ stretch and pitch
+ stretch = 114.9% (it rounds it from 115% for some reason)
+ wait
+ save

+ open file in iTunes
+ go to the song
+ stop it from playing
+ add to `svenska` playlist
+ open info
+ change media kind to `podcast`
+ check `skip when shuffling`
+ change podcast to the same name as the title

+ sync to iPhone
  (I do this by syncing all podcasts in the `svenska` playlist
