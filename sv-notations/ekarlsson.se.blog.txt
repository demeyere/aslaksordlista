###  "Dåligast" and some verbs

At the moment I'm reading a book called "Världens dåligaste språk" (World's baddest language) written by a Swedish author named Fredrik Lindström. He's also a comedian and a director. The title of the book is a play with words, because the word "dåligaste" doesn't exist in the Swedish language. Although it is often used by kids, because they think of this rule:
  
A sentence could look like this:

Olof var den starkaste pojken i klassen  _Olof was the strongest boy in the class_

(it is written starkaste with an 'e' added, because it's a description of the boy)

But, take a look at this:

dålig, sämre, sämst   bad, badder, baddest

All of a sudden, we've got two other words instead of expected "dåligare, dåligast". I don't know why this was decided, but it's just the way it is.

Here are some verbs that the Swedish language helps making shorter:

Put out the cigarette - fimpa
Taking off clothes - näcka
Sending a text message - sms:a
Sending a fax message - faxa
Having lunch - luncha

###  Var & Vart

Var and vart are used in questions. It means _where_, but in different ways. Say you wanted to know where you and your friends were going (a location).

__Vart_ ska vi gå nu?_ Where shall we go now?  

In this case you should use "vart" because theres' _activity_ involved in the question. You're asking about where you're going; wherever it is, you're *going* to get there.

"Var" is used in questions that asks where a certain thing is located:
  
__Var_ är min strumpa?_ Where is my sock?  

Therefore, "Var" is used in questions about something _static_, not moving from its place.

Most swedes are lazy with these two words, they only use "Vart" in both cases which is wrong. I don't know what's up with them people :)

###  Att & Som

Roughly translated, both _att_ and _som_ means `that`.

But they are different in one way,
  
_Att_ is used in questions or statements that refers to possible or definite outcomes. "Is this going to happen?", "Will he make it?", "This is what we'll do." and so on.

_Tror du _att_ han klarar av det?_ Do you think that he will make it?  
  
In parts:

Tror du att - do you think that
han klarar av det - he will make it

_Som_ on the other hand is a word to use when you're talking or asking about a subject, a place or an action, but not any kind of question. For example, questions with a request doesn't apply: "Could you fetch me my towel?". Instead, sentences like "There's that girl who won the game last night", and "Is that the dog who bit you?", "The man who would be king".

I hope you understand what I mean, because it is very difficult for me to explain.

_Är det den där skivan _som_ du så gärna ville ha?_ Is that the album that you wanted so badly?  
  
In parts:

Är det den där - Is that the
skivan - album
som du - that you
så gärna ville ha - wanted so badly
  
But the words __kommer att__ together means will or going to, gonna:

_Jag kommer att köpa en bil idag_ I will buy a car today or I'm going to buy a car today

###  Possessive pronouns in Swedish

The words "sin", "sitt" and "sina" are reflexive possessive pronouns in Swedish. According to Wikipedia, "A reflexive pronoun is a pronoun that is preceded by the noun or pronoun to which it refers (its antecedent) within the same clause".
  
As you can see, it doesn't differ between genders. But here's the tricky part. Remember en, ett, den and det? The reflexive possessive pronoun changes because of the noun being used in the sentence (in this case, stol becomes stolen when defined, since it's "en stol - a chair" and "stolen - the chair").

Sitt is also used with singular objects, like this:

Hon skadade sitt knä - She hurt her knee
  
As with sin, sitt doesn't differ between genders either. And the only reason for using sitt in this example is because knä becomes knäet when defined (as the Swedish language doesn't have a word for "the", I hope you know that by now :)

Sina is used with two objects or more, plural. It doesn't change form at all.  

Han skrev ett brev till sina föräldrar - He wrote a letter to his parents
Katten slickade sina tassar - The cat was licking its paws

- - -

skeleton - skelett
hide-and-seek - kurragömma
scary - skrämmande
basement - källare
rotten - rutten
janitor - vaktmästare
cleaning - städning
electricity - elektricitet
doorknob - dörrhandtag
pull - rycka
hinge - gångjärn
slumped - hopsjunken
identify - identifiera
champion - mästare
