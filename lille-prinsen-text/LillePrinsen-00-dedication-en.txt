To Leon Werth

I beg all the children forgiveness since I dedicated this book to an adult.
I have an excuse that is enough: he is my very best friend.
I have another excuse: in spite of his being an adult, he can understand everything, including a children's book.
I have a third excuse: my friend lives in France where he is hungry and cold.
He, in fact, needs something to be comforted with.
If all these excuses are not enough, I will gladly dedicate the book to the child that he once was.
All grown ups have once been children.
(But there are not many of them that remember that.)
I accordingly change my dedication:

To Leon Werth as a little boy
