Far out in the lonely wasteland, a pilot makes an emergency landing with his plane. 
At dawn, he hears a little voice "Can you draw a lamb for me please?" 
This is the Little Prince. 
The pilot doesn't understand a thing about what is happening. 
But he understands that he would do his best to comply. 
He took out paper and pen and began to draw... 

Thus begins the story of the Little Prince, one of the largest children's books whose message still hits us right in the heart.
Ever since it was first published in 1946, it has been loved all over the world.
The author himself died in a plane crash in 1944 and never experienced its success.
But his little prince keeps on living
